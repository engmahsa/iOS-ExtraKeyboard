# iOS-ExtraKeyboard
Customize the standard iOS keyboard to any style you want.
You can create some custom views and use it instead of standard iOS keyboard view. For example in some messaging applications you may need to switch to sticker keyboard or you may want to load your gallery asset in related area .So you can use the code to switch different custom views .Iâ€™ve also assign textView to the keyboard to make  more similar view to a messaging app.
